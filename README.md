# ***Airbnb Bookings Analysis***

## Project Type - EXPLOTORY DATA ANALYSIS

### Project Summary - 
üåê What is Airbnb:- Airbnb is an American company operating an online marketplace for short-and-long-term homestays, experiences and services in various countries and regions. It acts as a broker and charges a commission from each booking. Airbnb was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk, and Joe Gebbia. It is the best-known company for short-term housing rentals.

‚ú® How Airbnb Has Transformed Travel:- Airbnb has revolutionized the way people travel and experience new places by providing a unique and personalized alternative to traditional hotel stays. By connecting hosts who have extra space in their homes or apartments with travelers looking for a more authentic and local experience, Airbnb has created a thriving community of people from all over the world who are passionate about exploring new cultures and sharing their own.

üéØ Project Objective:- This project aims to explore and analyze a dataset of approximately 49,000 Airbnb listings in order to gain a better understanding of the factors that drive success on the platform. The dataset includes both categorical and numeric variables, such as the location of the listing, the type of property, the price, the number of reviews, and the amenities offered.

‚ùì Key Questions:- One of the key questions we can explore using this data is what sets successful hosts apart from those who may be struggling. By examining variables such as the number of bookings and reviews, the location of the listings, and the amenities offered, we can identify patterns and trends that may be correlated with higher levels of success.

üßº Data Exploration and Cleaning:- This project involved exploring and cleaning a dataset to prepare it for analysis. The data exploration process involved identifying and understanding the characteristics of the data, such as the data types, missing values, and distributions of values. The data cleaning process involved identifying and addressing any issues or inconsistencies in the data, such as errors, missing values, or duplicate records and remove outliers.

‚úÖ Clean and Prepared Data:- Through this process, we were able to identify and fix any issues with the data, and ensure that it was ready for further analysis. This is an important step in any data analysis project, as it allows us to work with high-quality data and avoid any potential biases or errors that could affect the results. The clean and prepared data can now be used to answer specific research.

üîç Data Exploration and Pattern Detection:- Once the data has been cleaned and prepared, now begin exploring and summarizing it with describe the data and creating visualizations, and identifying patterns and trends in the data. in explore the data, may develop the relationships between different variables or the underlying causes of certain patterns or trends and other methods.

üìä Data Visualization:- using data visualization to explore and understand patterns in Airbnb data. We created various graphs and charts to visualize the data, and wrote observations and insights below each one to help us better understand the data and identify useful insights and patterns.
